# FIT5152 Usability - S2 2024

## Submission 2 - Storyboarding and Low-Fidelity Prototypes

### Overview
Designing and developing an application or website can be a significant investment of time and money. To ensure that the final product meets user needs and is free of usability issues, creating storyboards and low-fidelity prototypes is a valuable approach. Storyboards help understand the user's context, thoughts, and emotional responses, while low-fidelity prototypes allow for quick and inexpensive exploration of design ideas.

### Individual Task

#### 1. Storyboarding
Select two user stories from submission 1 that were prioritized as either "Must" or "Should." Create storyboards for each of these user stories, ensuring the following:
- Illustrate the story of a specific persona and include the persona's name.
- Refer to a specific user story with a clear goal.
- Have 4 to 6 frames in each storyboard.
- Include a brief text description under each visual, considering users' emotions and thoughts. At least one storyboard should depict a user with an accessibility consideration or requirement.

For example, if one of the user stories is about a visually impaired user named Persona A who wants to easily navigate an app, the storyboard could show Persona A using a screen reader to access different sections of the app. The frames might include Persona A opening the app, hearing the welcome message from the screen reader, navigating to a specific feature, and successfully completing a task. The text descriptions could explain Persona A's thoughts and emotions at each stage, such as "Persona A is excited to try out the new app and hopes it will be accessible."

#### 2. Low fidelity prototype
Now that you have a better understanding of your users and the problem you're trying to solve through storyboarding, create low-fidelity prototype screens.
- Provide sketches of three low-fidelity prototype screens that implement some acceptance criteria from the selected user stories. For example, the app's "Home" screen, a "Search Results" screen, etc. Assume the user is already logged in; do not sketch a sign-up/sign-in screen.
- List the acceptance criteria in Kanban format for the selected user stories. For each user story, a minimum of three acceptance criteria must be implemented per user story, and these criteria can be spread across multiple screens. Update the Kanban board with how the criteria were implemented in the 'Done' column.
- Consider accessible and inclusive design. Nominate three of Norman's Design Principles and three Accessibility Guidelines/Principles (Perceivable, Operable, and Understandable) and annotate your prototypes with labels to show where they have been applied. For example, a label on a button could say "Applied Norman's Principle of Affordance - This button clearly indicates it can be clicked."
- The screens should ideally be hand-drawn and then scanned/photographed and uploaded into your report.

#### 3. Discussion
Write a brief report (800 - 1000 words) explaining the important decisions made when designing the prototype:
- Justify the user stories and acceptance criteria selected for implementation. Explain why this set of criteria was chosen over others and how it supports the design decisions. For example, if a user story focuses on quick access to frequently used features, explain how implementing specific acceptance criteria such as a prominent shortcut on the home screen addresses this need.
- Provide clear explanations of how the nominated Norman's principles have been applied by referencing the annotated screens of the prototype. For instance, if the principle of visibility is applied, explain how elements on the screen are made visible to the user and why this is important for usability.
- Explain how accessibility and inclusive design have been addressed through the accessibility guidelines/principles in the prototype. Refer to the annotated screens to show where these principles have been implemented. For example, if the principle of perceivable design is applied, explain how text is made larger for better visibility or how colors are chosen for color-blind users.
